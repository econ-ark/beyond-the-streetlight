# Beyond the Streetlight

This REMARK contains Christopher Carroll's discussion of Carol Corrado and
Arthur Kennickell's paper "100 years of Economic Measurement in the Division of
Research & Statistics: Beyond the Streetlight", presented at the Federal
Reserve Board's R&S Centennial Conference on November 6-8, 2023, together with
the code and data behind the discussion's figures.

## The argument

The discussion treats measurement as information production. Beyond primary
data (such as the Survey of Consumer Finances) and secondary data (such as
industrial production), the Fed produces "tertiary" information: the staff
forecasts in the Greenbook and Tealbook, staff memos, and similar work. The
Greenspan Fed's call of a "new economy" in the mid-1990s is the leading example
of that information being used well. The discussion asks whether the Fed was
just lucky then, or whether forecasting has improved over time, at the Fed and
elsewhere, as better measurement would imply.

## What the code does

The analysis compares two sets of forecasts with what actually happened:

- **Greenbook/Tealbook (GB)**: the Federal Reserve Board staff forecasts,
  from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Greenbook data set;
- **Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF)**: the mean private-sector
  forecast, also from the Philadelphia Fed;
- **Realized values**: the unemployment rate (FRED series `UNRATE`) and real
  personal consumption expenditures (`DPCERA3Q086SBEA`).

For each quarter it builds a year-ahead forecast of the change in unemployment
and of real consumption growth, computes the absolute forecast error, and
regresses the error on a time trend with heteroskedasticity-robust (HC3)
standard errors, over the full sample (144 quarters, labeled 1983Q1-2018Q4)
and from 1995 on.

## Findings

Errors in forecasts of real consumption growth have fallen significantly, for
both forecasters. Over the full sample the trend is -0.039 percentage points a
year for the Greenbook and -0.031 for the SPF (both p < 0.001), and it remains
negative after 1995. Errors in forecasts of the change in unemployment show no
significant trend. The two figures in the slides show the consumption results.

## Reproducing the results

`./reproduce.sh` regenerates every table and figure from the raw data, checks
them against the committed versions, and renders the slides; it takes about 30
seconds once the environment (pinned in `uv.lock`) is installed. It needs no
network access or API key: the realized values come from a committed snapshot of
the FRED data used for the published results. See `README.md` for Docker, conda
and Binder instructions and for a description of every output.
